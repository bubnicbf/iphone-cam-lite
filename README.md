# iphone-cam-lite

Lightweight helpers to use my iPhone as a webcam (Continuity Camera) on a Mac (tested on macOS Ventura+) for Zoom and Teams with no third-party drivers.

## What this does

- One-command launch for Zoom/Teams and auto-select **iPhone Camera** + **iPhone Microphone** via AppleScript UI scripting.
- Quick checks for Continuity Camera prerequisites.
- Optional `keepawake` to prevent macOS from sleeping during long calls.
